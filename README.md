# Football_Bayesian_Inference

Using Bayesian modelling to predict football scores through the use of the probabilistic programming library pymc

Implemented and improved the model detailed here https://youtu.be/911d4A1U0BE?si=bB5Q7Vppit837At8.
Solved issues with making out of sample predictions.
Experimented with further hierarchical components to simulate 'game effects'.
Weighted games from recent seasons higher to increase accuracy on future predictions.
